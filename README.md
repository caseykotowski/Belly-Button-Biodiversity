# Belly Button Biodiversity
A javascript site used to show graphs on whether there are belly button bacteria suitable to synthesize meat


## Purpose

I was provided with a data set of bacteria samples found in bellybuttons. From there it was my job to create a page that can pull up the metadata for different samples, as well as visualize the data using a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge chart. 

These charts will allow the company who is doing this research to pick out bacteria that could be good subjects for snythetic meat production.
